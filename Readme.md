# Homework 7 - To Do List App with Mongo

There is **1 part** to this homework.

Non-working code is **not** an incomplete. Please turn in any code you have. 

**This homework is due Tuesday October 2nd at 5pm.** Late submissions are not accepted.

## Part 1: To Do List Application with Mongo

For the main part of this week's homework, you need to take last week's to do list and use Mongo for persistant data storage.

Your application's front-end will remain the same, but instead of storing to do list items in the Node application, you must use a Mongo database and Mongoose to store those to do list items. This way if the application exits, the to do list items still exist.

### You need to meet the following requirements

- The requirements from the last homework still apply
- You must use a Mongo database hosted on Heroku using the mLab add-on
- You must use the Mongoose Node module to connect with the Mongo database
- The to do list items must be stored in Mongo and can not be stored in your Node application
- Deploy the final application to Heroku (using hosted Mongo database via mLab add-on) and submit **two** links: a Heroku link and your Github repo link
